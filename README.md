# [Predicting MLB Wins Project Overview](https://github.com/JSSheehan/MLB-Predictions-2018)
This project predicts the overall wins for each MLB team based on certain statistics. 
The code uses MLB statistics from 1998-2017 to find variables correlated to wins.It then uses these variables to predict the number of games each team will win for the whole season based on how they have performed over the first two months. The model predicted the top teams in 2018 to be the Yankees, Cubs, Astros, and Red Sox, which was almost true with the Yankees, Astros, and Red Sox being the top three teams and the Cubs narrowly finishing behind the A's and Brewers (after a 163rd game).
